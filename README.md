# CaseStudy : Instant Chat
## This is an app called instant chat. In order to run it, all you have to do is open the POM.XML and click run. It will post to localhost:8080.
Once you have the app running, you will be brought to a login page. Click the register button and create an account, then login.
You may test the chat by creating two accounts and using two instances of Instant chat to communicate between the two accounts.
